# IBI Group Glasgow Front End Developer Technical Test

Create a React App that reads traffic information and displays it in an easy-to-read format.

## Objectives

Demonstrate your technical abilities by completing the following objectives:

- Create a React based app that handles the pulling of data from the following API endpoints
  - [Glasgow traffic counter locations](https://gcc.azure-api.net/traffic/locations?format=json)
  - [Glasgow traffic movement data](https://gcc.azure-api.net/traffic/movement?format=json)
- Use the above data to display (at the very least) vehicle flow and location description about each traffic counter site.
- Copy and update this readme with details of the final solution into your repository.
- Email us a link to your repository so that we can download, view and run your solution.

### Additional Considerations

- What is the best way of presenting the information so that it is easy to consume? E.g. list, map.
- What data validation and error handling is required to ensure the app can handle invalid or failed data requests?
- How can the UX be improved to make it easy for the user to find the information that they are looking for?
